## Where Your Decisions Shape the Future

As the leader of a nation in crisis, you stand at the precipice of change. Your country teeters on the brink, and every decision you make will echo through time, shaping the destiny of your people and the world around you.

Will you prioritize the environment, bolster the economy, strengthen your military, or focus on social reforms? Be warned: each choice carries unforeseen consequences that may return to challenge you in unexpected ways.

Swipe left or right to make your decisions, but remember: in the game of power, there are no easy choices.
